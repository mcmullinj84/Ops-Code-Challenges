# Ops-Code-Challenges

Welcome! 

This repo is a collection of coding assignments centered around learning the fundamentals of Python, Bash and PowerShell. Assingments are from three Code Fellows courses; Ops 201: Foundations of Computer Operations, Ops 301: Networking and System Administration, and Ops 401: Cybersecurity Engineering.

I am learning these skills to increase my overall efficiency when completing cybersecurity tasks in the terminal. Through these exercises I learned how to use functions, variables, loops, arguments, and conditionals. Ultimately, I was able to automate some security related processes such as back-ups, encryption, and port scanning.

## Ops 201 
My favorite Ops 201 Challenge was from [Class 13](https://github.com/mcmullinj84/Ops-Code-Challenges/blob/main/ops201d8-day13.sh). It is a simple bash script using <nslookup>. However, it was the first bash script I wrote that came 'naturally', without having to work out multiple errors or reference a syntax guide every line. 

Shell scripting can help immensely to automate routine cybersecurity functions and search large datasets. 

## Ops 301 
The [final assignment](https://github.com/mcmullinj84/Ops-Code-Challenges/blob/main/ops301d8-day14.py) from Ops 301 was analysis of some malware code. I was able to go line-by-line through the code and identify what was happening without having to actually run the program.

## Ops 401 
So far, my favorite part of Ops 401 has been creating a [python script](https://github.com/mcmullinj84/Ops-Code-Challenges/blob/main/ops401d8-day07.py) to encrypt/decrypt files and/or directories.
